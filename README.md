I have an old pope picture on glass frames with a background light and a rotating disc. 
It's just a merchandising product. For many years, at every time we had a lan party we powered 
the pope device on until the background light broke.

So it's time to fix it up.

This is the main repo where we collecting ideas as hardware descriptions.

Here is a video of the pope without the frame:

You can see there is a rotating background glass, that creates the holy shine effect :-)
